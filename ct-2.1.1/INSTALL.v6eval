Terminology
===========

Tester Node (TN)
	A tester node for the conformance tests.

Node Under Test (NUT)
	A testee node for the conformance tests.

Network Under Test
	The network where the conformance tests are executed.

Tester Interface
	The network interface of TN
	hooked up to the Network Under Test.

Interface Under Test
	The network interface of NUT
	hooked up to the Network Under Test.



Prerequisites
=============

Prerequisites for TN:
	- The package supports FreeBSD 4.6 or higher.
	- The package can also coexist with FreeBSD 4.X version of KAME.



Installing the package onto TN (the case of FreeBSD 4.X-RELEASE)
================================================================

0. Install FreeBSD 4.X-RELEASE

1. Extracting the package

	% cd $SOMEWHERE
	% tar zxvf v6eval-X.X.tar.gz

2. Installing perl-related modules

	The package requires the below-listed perl5 modules.

		- Expect
		- IO-Stty
		- IO-Tty

	you can install them from the package's ports directory.

		# (cd /usr/ports/lang/p5-Expect; make install)

3. Compiling & installing the tool

	Install the Tool in /usr/local/v6eval directory.

		% cd $SOMEWHERE/v6eval-X.X

		# make install

4. Make bpf special device.

		# cd /dev
		# ./MAKEDEV bpf1 bpf2 bpf3 bpf4 bpf5 bpf6 bpf7
		# chmod 660 bpf*

	The user who executes conformance test need to belong in wheel group.

5. Configure serial line

		# touch /var/log/aculog
		# chown uucp:dialer /var/log/aculog
		# chmod 660 /var/log/aculog

5. Interface configuration

	At least, one interface used in testing, must be 'up' status.

		/etc/rc.conf
		----------------------------------------------------------------
		ifconfig_<Link0_device>="up"
		----------------------------------------------------------------

Configuration of TN
===================

1. Configuration of the network

Hook up the Tester Interface of TN to the Network Under Test.
Tester Interface of TN can be configured for IPv4 and for IPv6 as well.
Hook up the Interface Under Test of NUT to the Network Under Test.
Interface Under Test of NUT must be configured for IPv6, while it can be
configured for IPv6 too.

Make sure that any other nodes are not hooked up to the network
because their packets would disturb the conformance tests.

Example:

	TN			NUT
	 | Tester I/f: de0	 | I/f Under Test: de0
	 |			 |
        -+-----------------------+- Link0
	     Network Under Test

This document assumes that NUT is a host implementation.



2. Software Configuration
 
You must write two configuration files tn.def and nut.def in
/usr/local/v6eval/etc/. There are sample files tn.def.sample and
nut.def.sample in the directory.

These files have the following format:
	- Empty lines and lines starting with '#' are comments.
	- Otherwise, a line is in the format "keyword arguments".

(i) Format of tn.def

tn.def defines information about TN.
The file has the following entries:

	LinkX		Specifies interface name and MAC address
			of a Tester Interface:

			Link0   de0     00:00:00:00:01:00
			~~~~~   ~~~     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			(1)    (2)      (3)

			(1): a link name.
			     Note that the current version of the Tool
			     supports only "Link0" for (1), and does not accept
			     any other entry.

			(2): the EXACT name of a Tester Interface.

			(3): a BOGUS ether source address of
			     a Tester Interface.
			     Note that (3) "00:00:00:00:01:00" must be
			     different from the interface's MAC address.

	RemoteCuPath	Specifies cu command path.

			Default: /usr/bin/cu

	RemoteDevice	Specifies the device to be used for remote control.

			Default: cuaa0

	RemoteDebug	Specifies debug level for remote control.

			Default: 0

	RemoteLog	Specifies log level for remote control.

			Default: 0

	RemoteSpeed	Specifies interval that characters are sent at.

			Default: 0 (sec.)

	RemoteLogout	Enable/disable logout
			0: logout is omitted
			1: do logout every remote command invocation

			Default: 0

	RemoteMethod	Enable/disable remote command invocation.
			serial: enable it.
			none:   disable it.

			Default: serial


(ii) Format of nut.def

nut.def file defines information about NUT.
The file has the following entries:

	System		Specifies system type of NUT. The Tool
			switches remote control methods by the entry 
			but currently supports only "kame-freebsd" type.

			Default: kame-freebsd

	TargetName	Specifies system information of NUT such as 
			version and CPU type, etc. This entry will be
			displayed in test result file.

			Default: null

	HostName	Specifies the name of NUT.

			Default: null

	Type		Specifies NUT type.
			Either "host" or "router" is acceptable.

			It can not be omitted.

	User		Specifies the account name of NUT's super user.

			Default: root

	Password	Specifies the password of NUT's super user.

			Default: v6eval

	LinkX		Specifies interface name and MAC address
			of a Interface Under Test:

			Link0   de0     00:00:00:00:01:00
			~~~~~   ~~~     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			(1)    (2)      (3)

			(1): a link name.
			     Note that the current version of the Tool
			     supports only "Link0" for (1), and does not
			     accept any other entry.

			(2): the EXACT name of a Interface Under Test.

			(3): The EXACT ether source address of
			     a Interface Under Test.
			     Note that (3) 00:00:00:00:01:00 must be same with
			     the interface's MAC address.


(iii) Customizing tn.def

Copy sample tn.def to tn.def. Then, adjust Link0 entry
in the file.

	# cd /usr/local/v6eval/etc
	# cp tn.def.sample tn.def
	# vi tn.def

For example, if TN has NE2000 compatible NIC for Tester Interface,
you must set "ed0" instead of "de0".

	sample: /usr/local/v6eval/etc/tn.def
	================================================================
	...
	Link0 de0 00:00:00:00:01:00
	...   ~~~ change i/f name to the exact one 
	================================================================


(iv) Customizing nut.def

Copy sample nut.def to nut.def. Then, adjust Link0 entry in the file.

	# cd /usr/local/v6eval/etc
	# cp nut.def.sample nut.def
	# vi nut.def

For example, if TN has NE2000 compatible NIC for Interface
Under Test, you must set "ed0" instead of "de0". Its MAC address
must be set to the exact one too.

	sample: /usr/local/v6eval/etc/nut.def
	================================================================
	...
	Link0 de0 00:00:92:a7:6d:f5
	...   ~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Change i/f name and address
	                            to the exact ones.
	================================================================



Running samples
===============

The package does not contain IPv6 Conformance Test, but only some of
its samples. After running samples, you can see the report in the directory
by Web Browser. Since they are samples, you do not have to worry even
when you see the word "FAIL" in the report.

	$ cd $SOMEWHERE/v6eval-X.X/sample
	$ /usr/local/v6eval/bin/autorun INDEX
	$ netscape index.html



Have a problem?
===============

Can you execute following command?
	$ tcpdump -i <Link0_device>

Can you execute following command?
	$ cu -l /dev/cuaa0

	Can you see login prompt of NUT?



Running Conformance Test
========================

To run IPv6 Conformance Test, please refer to INSTALL.ct.
