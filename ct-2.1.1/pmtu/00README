* First of all

	This is a set of conformance tests for IPv6 Path MTU discovery
	that is based upon RFC1981.

* Test coverage

	The test coverage is the followings:

					
	            |     the NUT type      |
	Category    | host      | router    | comments
	------------+-----------+-----------+-------------------
	Path MTU    | done      |almost done|
	------------+-----------+-----------+-------------------


* How to run the tests

	# vi /usr/local/v6eval/etc/tn.def
	# vi /usr/local/v6eval/etc/nut.def
	% cp -Rp /usr/local/v6eval/ct $SOMEWHERE
	% cd $SOMEWHERE
	% make test
		* NOTE:see lower compatibility
	% netscape index.html

	If you know more about it,
	please see /usr/local/v6eval/doc/INSTALL.ct.


* Lower Compatibility
	In ct-2.1.1 pmtu discovery tests are swapped by newer test.
	If you want to run newer tests, please type following command line.
		% make test
		or
		% make tahi

	If you want to run older tests, please type following command line.
		% make legacy-test
		or
		% make legacy-tahi

	From ct-2.1.1 the older tests(for legacy-test or legacy-tahi)
	are out of support.
	So we recommend using newer tests.
	Please use following command.
		% make test
		or
		% make tahi

	If you want tu run test for node which does not support PMTU 
	type following command line.
		% make tiny
