IH_BadIPv6Ver - Bad IPv6 Version

=head1 TARGET

Host and Router

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<IH_BadIPv6Ver.seq>

=head1 INITIALIZATION

NONE

=head1 TEST PROCEDURE

This is one of robustness tests for bad Version field.

The test check that Version field in IPv6 header
processing.

  1. Send bad Echo Request
  2. Wait 5 sec.
  3. Send Echo Request
  4. If NS received then send NA, and wait Echo Reply again
  5. Receive Echo Reply


  Bad Echo Request Data is:

=over 4
        IPv6 Header
            Version            = 5 (True value is 6)
            Traffic Class      = 0
            FlowLabel          = 0
            NextHeader         = 58 (ICMP)
            HopLimit           = 64
            SourceAddress      = Tester Link Local Address
            DestinationAddress = Target Link Local Address

        ICMP Echo Request
            Type           = 128 (Echo Request)
            Code           = 0
            Checksum       = (auto)
            Identifier     = 0xffff
            SequenceNumber = 1
            PayloadData    = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
