  1. Send Echo Request
  2. Wait Echo Reply or NS
  3. If NS received then send NA, and wait Echo Reply again
  4. Receive Echo Reply

=head1 REFERENCE

RFC2460

3.  IPv6 Header Format

   Hop Limit            8-bit unsigned integer.  Decremented by 1 by
                        each node that forwards the packet. The packet
                        is discarded if Hop Limit is decremented to
                        zero.
