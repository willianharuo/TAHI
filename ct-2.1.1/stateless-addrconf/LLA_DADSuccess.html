5.3.  Creation of Link-Local Addresses
<BR>
   (omit)
<BR>
<A NAME="REF"><B>
   A link-local address is formed by prepending the well-known link-
   local prefix FE80::0 [ADDR-ARCH] (of appropriate length) to the
   interface identifier</B></A>. If the interface identifier has a length of N
   bits, the interface identifier replaces the right-most N zero bits of
   the link-local prefix.  If the interface identifier is more than 118
   bits in length, autoconfiguration fails and manual configuration is
   required. Note that interface identifiers will typically be 64-bits
   long and based on EUI-64 identifiers as described in [ADDR-ARCH].
<BR>
   A link-local address has an infinite preferred and valid lifetime; it
   is never timed
   out.
<BR>
5.4.  Duplicate Address Detection
<BR>
   <B>Duplicate Address Detection is performed on unicast addresses prior
   to assigning them to an interface whose DupAddrDetectTransmits
   variable is greater than zero</B>. Duplicate Address Detection MUST take
   place on all unicast addresses, regardless of whether they are
   obtained through stateful, stateless or manual configuration, with
   the exception of the following cases:

5.4.3.  Receiving Neighbor Solicitation Messages
<BR>
   On receipt of a valid Neighbor Solicitation message on an interface,
   node behavior depends on whether the target address is tentative or
   not.  <B>If the target address is not tentative (i.e., it is assigned to
   the receiving interface), the solicitation is processed as described
   in [DISCOVERY]</B>.  If the target address is tentative, and the source
   address is a unicast address, the solicitation's sender is performing
   address resolution on the target; the solicitation should be silently
   ignored.  Otherwise, processing takes place as described below. In
   all cases, a node MUST NOT respond to a Neighbor Solicitation for a
   tentative address.

7.2.4.  Sending Solicited Neighbor Advertisements
<BR>
   A node sends a Neighbor Advertisement in response to a valid Neighbor
   Solicitation targeting one of the node's assigned addresses.  The
   Target Address of the advertisement is copied from the Target Address
   of the solicitation.  If the solicitation's IP Destination Address is
   not a multicast address, the Target Link-Layer Address option MAY be
   omitted; the neighboring node's cached value must already be current
   in order for the solicitation to have been received.  If the
   solicitation's IP Destination Address is a multicast address, the
   Target Link-Layer option MUST be included in the advertisement.
   Furthermore, if the node is a router, it MUST set the Router flag to
   one; otherwise it MUST set the flag to zero.
<BR>
   If the Target Address is either an anycast address or a unicast
   address for which the node is providing proxy service, or the Target
   Link-Layer Address option is not included, the Override flag SHOULD
   be set to zero.  Otherwise, the Override flag SHOULD be set to one.
   Proper setting of the Override flag ensures that nodes give
   preference to non-proxy advertisements, even when received after
   proxy advertisements, and also ensures that the first advertisement
   for an anycast address "wins".
<BR>
   <B>If the source of the solicitation is the unspecified address, the
   node MUST set the Solicited flag to zero and multicast the
   advertisement to the all-nodes address.</B>  Otherwise, the node MUST set
   the Solicited flag to one and unicast the advertisement to the Source
   Address of the solicitation.
<BR>
   If the Target Address is an anycast address the sender SHOULD delay
   sending a response for a random time between 0 and
   MAX_ANYCAST_DELAY_TIME seconds.
   Because unicast Neighbor Solicitations are not required to include a
   Source Link-Layer Address, it is possible that a node sending a
   solicited Neighbor Advertisement does not have a corresponding link-
   layer address for its neighbor in its Neighbor Cache.  In such
   situations, a node will first have to use Neighbor Discovery to
   determine the link-layer address of its neighbor (i.e, send out a
   multicast Neighbor Solicitation).
