* First of all

	This is a set of conformance tests for IPv6 Stateless Address
	Autoconfiguration that is based upon RFC2462 and RFC2461.

* Test coverage

	The test coverage is the followings:

					
                                     | the NUT type            |
  Category                           | host       | router     | comments
 ------------------------------------+------------+------------+----------------
 1.DAD                                                           (*1)
   Stateless Address Configuration    almost done  almost done
   Manual Address Configuration       almost done  almost done   (*2)
 2.Creation of Global and Site-local
     address
   Router Advertisement Processing    almost done   N/A          (*3)
   Address Lifetime Expiry            almost done   N/A         
 3.Surprise                           half done     half done
 ------------------------------------+------------+------------+----------------
   (*1) except DupAddrDetectTransmits=0
   (*2) new test set does not supoprt manual address configuration yet.
	to run this test, please use legacy test.
	for more detail of legacy test, see Lower Compatibility section.
   (*3) except 
         stateful address configuration (M,O flag)
         ValidLifetime over 2H
         PrefixOption with AH

* How to run the tests

	# vi /usr/local/v6eval/etc/tn.def
	# vi /usr/local/v6eval/etc/nut.def
	% cp -Rp /usr/local/v6eval/ct $SOMEWHERE
	% cd $SOMEWHERE
	% make test
	% netscape index.html

	If you know more about it,
	please see /usr/local/v6eval/doc/INSTALL.ct.




* Lower Compatibility
	In ct-2.1.1 stateless address autoconfiguration tests are swapped by
	newer test.
	If you want to run newer tests, please type following command line.
		% make test
		or
		% make tahi

	If you want to run older tests, please type following command line.
		% make legacy-test
		or
		% make legacy-tahi

	From ct-2.1.1 the older tests(for legacy-test or legacy-tahi)
	are out of support.
	So we recommend using newer tests.
	Please use following command.
		% make test
		or
		% make tahi
