5.4.3.  Receiving Neighbor Solicitation Messages
<BR>
   On receipt of a valid Neighbor Solicitation message on an interface,
   node behavior depends on whether the target address is tentative or
   not.  If the target address is not tentative (i.e., it is assigned to
   the receiving interface), the solicitation is processed as described
   in [DISCOVERY].  If the target address is tentative, and the source
   address is a unicast address, the solicitation's sender is performing
   address resolution on the target; the solicitation should be silently
   ignored.  Otherwise, processing takes place as described below. In
   all cases, a node MUST NOT respond to a Neighbor Solicitation for a
   tentative address.
<BR>
<A NAME="REF">
   <B>If the source address of the Neighbor Solicitation is the unspecified
   address, the solicitation is from a node performing Duplicate Address
   Detection. If the solicitation is from another node, the tentative
   address is a duplicate and should not be used (by either node).</B> If
   the solicitation is from the node itself (because the node loops back
   multicast packets), the solicitation does not indicate the presence
   of a duplicate address.
</A>
<BR>
   Implementor's Note: many interfaces provide a way for upper layers to
   selectively enable and disable the looping back of multicast packets.
   The details of how such a facility is implemented may prevent
   Duplicate Address Detection from working correctly.  See the Appendix
   for further discussion.
<BR>
   The following tests identify conditions under which a tentative
   address is not unique:
<BR>
      - If a Neighbor Solicitation for a tentative address is
        received prior to having sent one, the tentative address is a
        duplicate.  This condition occurs when two nodes run Duplicate
        Address Detection simultaneously, but transmit initial
        solicitations at different times (e.g., by selecting different
        random delay values before transmitting an initial
        solicitation).
<BR>
      - If the actual number of Neighbor Solicitations received exceeds
        the number expected based on the loopback semantics (e.g., the
        interface does not loopback packet, yet one or more
        solicitations was received), the tentative address is a
        duplicate. This condition occurs when two nodes run Duplicate
        Address Detection simultaneously and transmit solicitations at
        roughly the same time.
