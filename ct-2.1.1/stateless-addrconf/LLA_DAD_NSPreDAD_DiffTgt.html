5.4.  Duplicate Address Detection
<BR>
   (omit)
   An address on which the duplicate Address Detection Procedure is
   applied is said to be tentative until the procedure has completed
   successfully.  A tentative address is not considered "assigned to an
   interface" in the traditional sense. <B>That is, the interface must
   accept Neighbor Solicitation and Advertisement messages containing
   the tentative address in the Target Address field, but processes such
   packets differently from those whose Target Address matches an
   address assigned to the interface. Other packets addressed to the
   tentative address should be silently discarded</B>.
<BR>
   (omit)
<BR>
5.4.2.  Sending Neighbor Solicitation Messages
<BR>
   Before sending a Neighbor Solicitation, an interface MUST join the
   all-nodes multicast address and the solicited-node multicast address
   of the tentative address.  The former insures that the node receives
   Neighbor Advertisements from other nodes already using the address;
   the latter insures that two nodes attempting to use the same address
   simultaneously detect each other's presence.
<BR>
   To check an address, a node sends DupAddrDetectTransmits Neighbor
   Solicitations, each separated by RetransTimer milliseconds. The
   solicitation's Target Address is set to the address being checked,
   the IP source is set to the unspecified address and the IP
   destination is set to the solicited-node multicast address of the
   target address.
<BR>
   If the Neighbor Solicitation is the first message to be sent from an
   interface after interface (re)initialization, the node should delay
   sending the message by a random delay between 0 and
   MAX_RTR_SOLICITATION_DELAY as specified in [DISCOVERY].  This serves
   to alleviate congestion when many nodes start up on the link at the
   same time, such as after a power failure, and may help to avoid race
   conditions when more than one node is trying to solicit for the same
<A NAME="REF">
   address at the same time. <B>In order to improve the robustness of the
   Duplicate Address Detection algorithm, an interface MUST receive and
   process datagrams sent to the all-nodes multicast address or
   solicited-node multicast address of the tentative address while
   delaying transmission of the initial Neighbor Solicitation.</B></A>
